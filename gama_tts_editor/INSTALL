- Requirements:

  - CMake (tested with version 3.18.4).

  - A C++ compiler with C++17 support.
    The following compiler has been tested:
    - GCC 10.2 (Linux+GNU x86_64).

  - Qt 5 (tested with version 5.15).

  - JACK Audio Connection Kit (tested with version 1.9.17) + QjackCtl.

  - FFTW - single precision (tested with version 3.3.8).

  - GamaTTS (use the latest version).
    The source files must be in ../gama_tts and the build directory
    must be ../gama_tts-build.

  - The current directory must be named "gama_tts_editor".

- Build (Linux+GNU):

  mkdir ../gama_tts_editor-build
  cd ../gama_tts_editor-build
  cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../gama_tts_editor
  cmake --build .

- Test (Linux+GNU):

  - Start the JACK server using QjackCtl (this step is not needed when using
    Pipewire).
    Note: The sampling rate in JACK must be equal to the value of the parameter
          "output_rate" in the file vtm.txt located in
          ../gama_tts/data/voice/english/*/.

  - Execute in the directory "gama_tts_editor-build":

    ./gama_tts_editor &

  - Go to File/Open and select the directory
    ../gama_tts/data/voice/english/5_male.

  - Open the synthesis window, enter some english text and click on "Parse".
