<p>Special Transitions are curves that indicate how a Posture parameter will vary between Postures during an articulation.
They are used when the normal Transitions are not flexible enough. Special Transitions are used in some articulations
involving consonants, and in micro-intonation.
</p>

<p>The column "Is used?" is read-only and indicates if the Special Transition is being used and how many times
it is referenced.
