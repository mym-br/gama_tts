<p>Categories are used to reduce the number of needed rules.
 Postures can be members of a Category.
 A rule can then match a Category instead of many individual Postures.
</p>

<p>The column "Is used?" indicates if the Category is in use.
The number shows how many times it is referenced.
A Category can't be removed if it is in use.
</p>
