<p>The Symbol values indicate the durations of each phase of the articulation.<br>
 Qssa (quasi steady state A) is the duration of the slow variation phase just before the center of the Posture.<br>
 Qssb (quasi steady state B) is the duration of the slow variation phase just after the center of the Posture.<br>
 Transition is the duration of the fast variation phase before of after the slow variation phases.<br>
 "Duration" is the total duration of the Posture, and is roughly equal to qssa + qssb + transition.<br>
 The symbols with the "marked" prefix are used for marked Postures.
