<p>Equations are used to calculate times from the values of Posture symbols.
Qssa1 is the value of qssa for the Posture 1, qssa2 is the value for Posture 2, and so on.
Equations can use constant times too (in milliseconds), if needed.
</p>

<p>The column "Is used?" is read-only and indicates if the Equation is being used and how many times
it is referenced.
