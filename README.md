GamaTTS
=======

GamaTTS is an *experimental* articulatory synthesizer that converts text to
speech.

GamaTTS started as a C++ port of the TTS_Server in the original [Gnuspeech][]
system developed for NeXTSTEP, provided by David R. Hill, Leonard Manzara,
Craig Schock and contributors.
The base was the code on Gnuspeech's Subversion repository, revision 672,
downloaded in 2014-08-02. The source code was obtained from the directories:

    nextstep/trunk/ObjectiveC/Monet.realtime
    nextstep/trunk/src/SpeechObject/postMonet/server.monet

Gnuspeech is licensed under the GNU GPLv3 or later.

speech synthesis.
